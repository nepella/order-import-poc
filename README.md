# order-import-poc
Proof of concept workaround needed until FOLIO supports importing MARC records to create orders.

### What does it do?
* It takes an uploaded file that contains MARC records and creates orders, instances, holdings, items and MARC records for each.
* It uses the 980 field to get the fund code, vendor code, price, tag, quantity, notes and electronic/print indicator
* It only creates items if the material is print (which should be indicated in the 980$z field) - It looks for the values ELECTRONIC or PRINT
* It lets FOLIO create the instance, holdings and item records using the "createInventory" value in the order line
* It does all of this using the FOLIO API
* It uses a property file to determine location, fiscal year, loan type, note type and material type and default text for electronic resources (in case subfield z is missing)

### API Calls
* Several get calls to initialize reference values (like instance types, material types, note types)
* Get next PO number (GET orders/po-number)
* Posts a purchase order (approved and open) and one line item for each MARC record in a file (POST orders/composite-orders)
* Retreives the puchase order (to get the ID of the instance FOLIO automatically created) (GET orders/composite-orders/theOrderUuid)
* Retreive the new instance (GET inventory/instances/theinstanceid)
* Posts to copycat (POST copycat/imports)

### If you want to try it
* copy the src/main/resources/application.properties.example file to src/main/resources/application.properties
* you will have to add the okapi userid/password and you may have to adjust the file upload path (where it will save the uploaded file)
* call: mvn jetty:run
* It should start a jetty server and you should be able to point your browser to http://localhost:8080/order-import-poc/import and try it
* The entry point URL is defined in the jetty-maven-plugin configuation section in the pom.xml file. It may be changed as needed
* I've included example MARC files but you will have to update them with your vendor, fund, object codes
* The first call is a bit slow because it initializes reference values/UUIDs


### Permissions
This app requires a FOLIO user account with the following permissions granted:

* `copycat.imports.post`
* `finance.budgets.collection.get`
* `finance.fiscal-years.collection.get`
* `finance.funds.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.classification-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.contributor-name-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.contributor-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.holdings-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.holdings.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.holdings.item.put`
* `inventory-storage.identifier-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.instance-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.loan-types.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.locations.collection.get`
* `inventory-storage.material-types.collection.get`
* `inventory.all`
* `note.types.allops`
* `notes.domain.all`
* `notes.item.post`
* `orders.acquisitions-units-assignments.assign`
* `orders.all`
* `orders.item.approve`
* `organizations-storage.organizations.collection.get`
* `tags.collection.get`
* `ui-orders.order.create`

### Lots of areas for improvement including:
* Better way to get data out of the MARC record to include on the instance.
* Better way to store reference values needed for lookup
* Current version contains some hard-coded values (e.g. currency: USD)
* If duplicate PO number error - get the next PO number and try again

### What's new?
* 1-15-2021
  - Add Docker Support: See [Docker.md](Docker.md)

* 11-16-2020
  - Removed reference to the 001 field.  Wasn't necessary and was causing an error when it was missing.

* 9-23-2020
  - Removed the check for enough money in the budget
  - Fixed where the electronic indicator is initialized (needed to be per record)

* 7-31-2020
  - Better handling of special characters
  - Handles multiple records in a file
  - Validates each record in the file
